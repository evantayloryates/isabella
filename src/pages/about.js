          Isabella Tagliati is an incredibly sm*rt, t*lented, and g*rgeous 
          s*permodel. In her downtime she acts, writes and directs (in no 
          particular order). She grew up in New York and LA (but sheâ€™s not 
          a bitch about it). She currently lives in Los Angeles with her cat, 
          life partner and muse, Mango.
